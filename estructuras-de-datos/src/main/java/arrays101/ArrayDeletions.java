		 * deletes the element at that index. Seeing as the length variable in our 
		 * examples tells us the next index where we can insert a new element,

		   that will create a vacant spot at the 0th index. To fill that spot, we 
		   will shift the element at index 1 one step to the left. Going by the ripple 
		   effect, every element all the way to the last one will be shifted one place 
		   to the left. This shift of elements takes O(N) time, where N is the number 
		   of elements in the Array.

		Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order 
		they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
